    <ul>
      <li>Collect or store personal data beyond the temporary display of your name within the app.</li>
      <li>Share your name or any other personal data with third parties (other than displaying it within the app itself, where it is not transmitted to external servers).</li>
    </ul>
  </p>

  <h2>4. Data Retention</h2>
  <p>
    <strong>User Name</strong>: We do <strong>not</strong> store or log your name on any external server. It is only saved locally in your device’s memory for display purposes.
